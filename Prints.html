<img src="Prints.webp" alt="Viewed from above in this 
image see two prints based on original paintings. The prints are without a mount or backing and are seen draped over one 
another with only a section of the lower print exposed on the right. The one on tope is based on a painting entitled 'After 
the Flood' and the other is 'Autumn Fllod at the Regional Park'." id="Prints"/>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Prints of selected works are available to purchase. Among these are paintings in oil and gouache. 
These are made professionally and of a very high quality that captures every detail.</div> 

<div id="section2">
<img src="PrintMounts.webp" alt="Here we see two more prints, 
both of which are seen mounted with thick canvas paper. These prints are based on the same original painting which was called 
'The Tall Trees and the Creek', a monochromatic piece painted using only raw umber, a warm brown tone. One of these is also draped 
over the other but this time the print on the right is over the other." id="PrintMounts"/>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Prints are available in standard sizes which may vary depending on the dimensions of the original paintings. The 
larger prints are all based on oil paintngs and come with mount and backing, as to be ready for framing. As
well as large prints I also have a selection of 8 A3 prints, also with mount and backing provided.</div>

<div id="section3">
<img src="Postcards.webp" alt="In this last picture we an 
array of postcards spread out in a fan formation. There are 5 postcards in total, all of which are based on gouache paintings. 
At the front of the formation and the only one visible in it's entirety is a post card based on the painting, 'Tall Trees at 
Farran Wood'." id="Postcards"/>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Finally I also have postcards available in sets of 5. All of these prints can be purchased from my <a id="etsy"
