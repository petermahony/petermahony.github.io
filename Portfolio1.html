<div id="galFarranbio" class="biotext">"This painting is the result of a trip to the Farran Wood park in 
Cork in 2021. The scene depicted takes place in November. The trees were bare and it was very cold.Getting 
out into nature during the pandemic was a relief but also an important opportunity for new work. In leading 
up to the finished painting I made premilinary work in pencil and gouache before beginning the piece. I began 
with an underpainting in acrylic before finally moving on to oil. Farran Wood was sold in the same year in exhibition."

individual taking a walk in a Winter scene. The colours of this work were inspired by two paintings which I had spent a lot 
of time looking at beforehand. Frosty Walk was painted and sold in 2019 but is available in print."
