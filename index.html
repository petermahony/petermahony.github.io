"I am a landscape artist, I work in gouache, acrylics and oils and I've painted for a number 
of years now, developing my craft and finding form for my work.For some time I was interested 
in the American style Tonalism wherein I would paint landscapes from imagination that were focused 
on limited colours and subject matter.<br><br> Now I have moved on from that and have become more engaged with working 
from nature with an emphasis on colour theory. While Tonalism was limiting, working from 
nature provides much more room to grow. I want my newer works to feel indicative of the 
Irish landscape, capturing its beauty and its bleakness."<br><br>
