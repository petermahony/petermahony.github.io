"I am a landscape artist and I work in gouache, acrylics and oils. When I was a child 
I was initially taught the fundamentals of painting by my aunt and uncle, who are both 
themselves painters. While studying English in college I began taking tuition from the 
artist John Jermyn. For a number of years now I have developed my craft in my studio trying 
to find form for my work. For some time I was interested in the American style Tonalism 
wherein I would paint landscapes from my mind that were focused on limited colours and 
subject matter. Now I have moved on from that and have become more engaged with working 
from nature with an emphasis on colour theory. While Tonalism was limiting, working from 
nature provides much more room to grow. I want my newer works to feel indicative of the 
Irish landscape, capturing its beauty and its bleakness."
