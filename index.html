<div id="Farranbio">"This painting is the result of a trip to the 
Farran Wood park in Cork in 2021. The scene depicted takes place in November. The trees 
were bare and it was very cold.Getting out into nature during the 
pandemic was a relief but also an important opportunity for new work.  
In leading up to the finished painting I made premilinary work in pencil and gouache before 
beginning the piece. I began with an underpainting in acrylic before finally 
moving on to oil. Farran Wood was sold in the same year in exhibition."</div id="Farranbio">

<div id="sebio">"This imagined landscape is very far removed from the rough 
gouache sketch on which it is based. The original sketch was a fleeting capture 
of a scene at the Atlantic Pond, at the Marina walkway in Cork City. This 
work is available for purchase."</div id="sebio">

"I am a landscape artist and I work in gouache, acrylics and oils. When I was a child 
I was initially taught the fundamentals of painting by my aunt and uncle, who are both 
themselves painters. While studying English in college I began taking tuition from the 
artist John Jermyn. For a number of years now I have developed my craft in my studio trying 
to find form for my work. For some time I was interested in the American style Tonalism 
wherein I would paint landscapes from my mind that were focused on limited colours and 
subject matter. Now I have moved on from that and have become more engaged with working 
from nature with an emphasis on colour theory. While Tonalism was limiting, working from 
nature provides much more room to grow. I want my newer works to feel indicative of the 
Irish landscape, capturing its beauty and its bleakness."
