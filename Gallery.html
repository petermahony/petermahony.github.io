<div id="galFarranbio">"This painting is the result of a trip to the 
Farran Wood park in Cork in 2021. The scene depicted takes place in November. The trees 
were bare and it was very cold.Getting out into nature during the 
pandemic was a relief but also an important opportunity for new work.  
In leading up to the finished painting I made premilinary work in pencil and gouache before 
beginning the piece. I began with an underpainting in acrylic before finally 
moving on to oil. Farran Wood was sold in the same year in exhibition."</div id="galFarranbio">

<div id="galsebio">"This imagined landscape is very far removed from the rough 
gouache sketch on which it is based. The original sketch was a fleeting capture 
of a scene at the Atlantic Pond, at the Marina walkway in Cork City. This 
work is available for purchase."</div id="galsebio">

<div id="frostybio">"Seen here finished on my easel before framing, this imagined
landscape depicts a lone individual taking a walk in a Winter scene. The colours of 
this work were inspired by two paintings which I had spent a lot of time looking at 
beforehand. Frosty Walk was painted and sold in 2019 but is available in print."</div id="frostybio">
