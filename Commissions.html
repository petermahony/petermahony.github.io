As well as painting the landscapes that affect me, I am alao available to paint the ones that mean something to you. 
If you have an idea for a painting you want but can't find anywhere. If there is a place that
is special or memorable to you in some way, then tell me about that place and I would be happy to accomodate 
you as best I can.<br><br> <img src="TRPsketch.img" id="TRPsketch"/> 
The painting seen above is titled August Flood, at the Regional Park and I was commissioned to paint it in 2021. The
focus of the painting was a large tree turning red in the Autumn. I began the work with some preliminary sketches and
diagrams, in order to figure out the best way to present the tree.<br><br>This commission was a very large piece so
it was important to me that before I started, I had a very good idea of what it would look like. After drawings I
diagrams I went to painting a small oil sketch of what the painting might look like. While I was happy with this preparatory
work I decided to change the composition.

All of the important details of this work were privided by the patrons who commissioned it. The tree, the time of year and
the colours throughout the piece were all important in creating the scene they wanted on their wall.<br><br>Having shown my plans
to the patrons and seeing that they were happy I could start the final bit of prep work, painting an underpainting. With everything
mapped out I could finally begin painting the scene you see above.

Please note that I am, at this time, solely a landscape artist. Please don't ask me to paint you or your cat, because I will
have to refuse. Finally, know that prices will depend entirely on the details and the amount of work in your commission.</div>
